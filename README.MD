### SIMPLE ASSEMBLER
The Code implements the  RV321 (RISC-V Subset), which reads assembly instructions from a text file and outputs 32-bit binary codes with proper data structure based on the instruction type.


The assembler and simulator support a basic set of RISC instructions, including but not limited to:

 - Arithmetic instructions (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
 - Logic instructions (AND, OR, XOR)
 - Memory instructions (load, store)
 - Control flow instructions (jump, branch)
 - Refer to the documentation or comments in the source code for the complete list of supported instructions.

## Instruction Format for all types:
